## Introduction
We propose Robust Network Architecture Search (RNAS) based on Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS). RNAS searches for a robust network architecture through restraining the latent feature distortion. 

## Usage
#### Search on CIFAR10

This part of the code is still being sorted out. During the review phase, we provide the search results, which will be published after the review. The search results are in file *genotypes.py*.

#### RNAS training and evaluation on CIFAR10

```
python RNAS_training.py
```
#### Other model training on CIFAR10

```
python other_models_training.py 
```

#### Other model evaluation on CIFAR10
```
python evaluation.py
```
